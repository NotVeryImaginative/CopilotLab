# Lab 2

## A brief description of scenario.
My scenario was to create a quick ecommerce database schema that could be used to track products, customers, orders, and order items.
I wanted to ensure that the schema included appropriate relationships between the tables.
I decided to not have huge tables for the sake of simplicity and to make it easier to understand the relationships.

## Copilot-generated code
Please refer to the file schema.sql for the fully generated code with the prompts.

## Observations on where Copilot helped or needed clarification.
Overall, Copilot was quite helpful in generating the SQL schema based on the prompts provided. 
It was able to understand the requirements for tables, relationships, and constraints effectively. 
However, there were a few instances where I had to clarify certain aspects like that the callendar should be self populated and i also had some issues with file generation where it would refuse to populate it. 
Overall, Copilot significantly sped up the development process and provided a solid foundation for the database schema.
