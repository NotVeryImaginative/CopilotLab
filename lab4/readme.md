# Lab 4 — Postgres SQL Scripts and Optimization Notes

## Overview (our imaginative case)
This repository contains SQL scripts created for a lab 4 business case. The scripts target a PostgreSQL database and include optimizations and suggestions for potential deployment to Amazon Redshift.

## Database & Tools
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Tools: GitHub Copilot (used extensively), Copilot Edit for on-the-fly generation and refinement of queries, minimum use of Ask for spining up a PostgresDB

## What I did
- Generated SQL queries for the provided dataset using Copilot.
- Created a separate file with suggestions and optimizations aimed at future possible Redshift deployment.
- Captured screenshots showing query outputs and results (attached in the repo).

## Files
- SQL scripts: (look in the project SQL folder)
- Optimization notes for Redshift
- Screenshots: (folder with images demonstrating query results)

## Notes
- Queries were written with PostgreSQL in mind; some adjustments are suggested for Redshift (see the optimization file).
- Copilot used to speed up query generation and iteration; manual review was performed.

## Challanges
Sometimes copilot would not recognise what files it needs to work on or would not generate files at all, creating a fresh chat fixes it
